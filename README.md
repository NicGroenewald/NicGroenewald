<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Nic 👋</h1>

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a second-year Computer Systems student at MTU Cork, working across software, hardware, and automation. I enjoy building programs, tools, and small systems that actually run efficiently—whether that's scripts that automate tasks, applications that solve real problems, or hardware projects that connect and communicate the way they're supposed to.

My GitHub currently includes LeetCode problem-solving work and a collection of coding projects I've been developing as I learn more about building apps, structuring programs, and improving the way systems interact.

I'm particularly interested in automation, full-stack development, and exploring how generative AI can make everyday tasks smarter and more streamlined. I like experimenting with new ideas, improving how I code, and diving deeper into how systems behave under the surface.

Always learning, always building, and always working toward writing cleaner, faster, and more reliable software.

I enjoy uncovering how a system works under the hood
